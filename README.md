# Arch config

## A simple arch config

You can download and execute the install file, or run this following code in the arch boot.

```curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bruno-caldas/arch-config/master/install.sh > install.sh```
```chmod +x install.sh```
```./install.sh```
Dialog is missing, so:
```arch-chroot /mnt```
```sudo pacman -S dialog```


Follow the steps to install.
